Manual for RayTrace program

The program is compiled with a scene ready to render.  To open an alternate file, use the File menu and select
"Open."  Though editing has been implemented, saving has not.  :(

To render your image, use the camera menu and select "Draw Screen."  For pre-final images, first select "Set
pixel resolution..." and choose a value higher than 1 (unless you are running on an incredibly fast machine or
don't mind waiting.  This sets the size of a ray in pixels.  If you enter a value of 3, each ray will take up
a space on the screen of 3x3 pixels.  Though this vastly degrades the quality of the images, it can likewise
improve the rendering time.

Use the world coordinate settings for the camera if you know exactly what point you would like to see.  Use
the camera coordinate settings for moving the camera if you just want to move around and see what everything
looks like.    In world coordinates, you start at location (0,0,15) and are looking back down the z axis
towards the origin.  Camera coordinates are:  horizontal to the right is x+, vertical in the upward direction
is y+, perpendicular to the screen away from viewer is z+.  Use these axes to reposition the camera and turn
the camera.

The light attenuation value will increase or decrease the general brightness of the screen.  This could be
considered ambient lighting, but is done differently.  This value is taken into account when the program
calculates how much to decrease the lighting based on distance to the light.  The light attenuation value
multiplies the result of this calculation.  Use higher values when you use large world coordinates.  Use
smaller values when you use smaller world coordinates.  The value defaults to 8.
